# Pythagorean-Theorem-and-Area-of-a-Circle-Calculator
Hi First of all, thank you very much for looking at my code block. This code is for Windows console (C#)  It serves to calculate the pythagorean torem and the area of a circle,
I emphasize that this code is very primitive with this I mean that I created it with very little knowledge so it is very likely that this is not optimized to 100% but it works
correctly.
DATA TO EMPHASIZE
* The code although it does not use much language, is in Spanish and not in English.
* The result is delivered with only 2 or 3 numbers after the comma
* It is my first project in Github and really my knowledge is very basic almost null so it would help me a lot if you report me the errors that the code could have.
* Enjoy :=))  
THIS CODE IS FOR CONSOLE
